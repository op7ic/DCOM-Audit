# DCOM-Audit

A comprehensive PowerShell-based security auditing tool for Windows DCOM (Distributed Component Object Model) permissions and configurations. DCOM-Audit provides deep analysis, vulnerability detection, attack scenario mapping, and actionable security recommendations for DCOM objects in Windows Environment.

## üî• Key Features

- **Comprehensive Permission Analysis**: Audits both Launch and Access permissions for all DCOM objects
- **Attack Scenario Detection**: Maps vulnerabilities to real-world attack techniques with examples
- **DLL Hijacking Detection**: Identifies writable DLL paths and phantom DLL opportunities
- **Service Security Analysis**: Checks permissions on DCOM-related Windows services
- **Interface Enumeration**: Identifies exposed COM interfaces and dangerous methods
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Identifies high-risk configurations and dangerous method exposures
- **Risk-Based Reporting**: Categorizes findings by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- **.NET Fallback Methods**: Ensures reliable auditing even when PowerShell methods fail
- **Performance Optimizations**: Significantly faster than v1.0 with parallel processing support
- **DCOM Hardening Verification**: Validates Windows DCOM security patches and configurations
- **Multiple Output Formats**: HTML reports, CSV exports, and console output
- **Mitigation Guidance**: Provides specific recommendations for each vulnerability
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**: Links findings to specific adversary techniques

## üõ°Ô∏è Features

### Advanced Attack Surface Analysis
- **DLL Permission Checking**: Identifies DLL hijacking opportunities in DCOM server paths
- **Service Permission Auditing**: Finds privilege escalation vectors via weak service ACLs
- **Interface Analysis**: Enumerates COM interfaces to identify scriptable objects
- **Known Exploit Detection**: Flags DCOM objects with documented exploitation techniques
- **x86/x64 Compatibility**: Handles architecture mismatches gracefully
- **Method Detection**: Uses multiple techniques to enumerate methods

### Attack Scenario Mapping
- Real-world exploitation examples for each vulnerability
- MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping
- Detection and prevention guidance
- Sample attack code for security testing

### Enhanced Detection Capabilities
- SIEM/EDR detection rules in multiple formats (Sigma, Splunk, ELK, KQL)
- PowerShell logging recommendations
- Network-based detection strategies
- Behavioral indicators of compromise

## üìã Requirements

- Windows 7/Server 2008 R2 or later
- PowerShell 4.0 or higher
- Administrative privileges (for complete audit)
- .NET Framework 4.5 or higher

## üöÄ Quick Start

```powershell
# Basic audit (permissions only)
.\DCOM-Auditor-Enhanced.ps1

# Full audit with method enumeration
.\DCOM-Auditor-Enhanced.ps1 -Audit

# Generate report with CSV export
.\DCOM-Auditor-Enhanced.ps1 -Audit -ExportCSV -OutputPath "C:\Reports"

# Check DCOM hardening status
.\DCOM-Auditor-Enhanced.ps1 -Audit -CheckMitigations

# Fast mode (skip method enumeration)
.\DCOM-Auditor-Enhanced.ps1 -FastMode
```

## üìä Output Examples

### Console Output
```
[!] Critical Risk: Everyone has Launch permissions (LocalLaunch, RemoteLaunch) for {00020906-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}
    Application: Microsoft Word Document

[!] WARNING: Dangerous methods found in {00000300-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}
    Methods: Shell, Execute, Navigate
```

### HTML Report
The tool generates a comprehensive HTML report including:
- Executive summary with risk statistics
- DCOM hardening status
- Prioritized recommendations
- Detailed findings table with color-coded risk levels

## üîç Understanding DCOM Permissions

| Permission Type | Description | Risk Implications |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **LocalLaunch** | Start COM server on local machine | Low risk if properly restricted |
| **RemoteLaunch** | Start COM server from remote machine | High risk if granted to broad groups |
| **LocalActivation** | Activate COM object locally | Medium risk depending on object |
| **RemoteActivation** | Activate COM object remotely | High risk for privileged objects |
| **LocalAccess** | Access running COM server locally | Low to medium risk |
| **RemoteAccess** | Access running COM server remotely | High risk if unrestricted |

## üõ°Ô∏è Risk Categories

### Critical Risk
- "Everyone" or "Authenticated Users" with remote permissions
- Non-admin users with access to dangerous methods
- Default permissions on sensitive DCOM objects

### High Risk
- Domain Users with launch/activation rights
- Remote access permissions for non-administrative groups
- Objects exposing dangerous methods without restrictions

### Medium Risk
- Local permissions for non-admin users
- Default permissions in use
- Missing DCOM hardening configurations

## üîß DCOM Security Hardening

### Apply KB5004442 Mitigations
The tool checks for and recommends the following hardening measures:

1. **Disable DCOM HTTP**
   ```
   HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Ole\EnableDCOMHTTP = 0
   ```

2. **Increase Authentication Level**
   ```
   HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Ole\DefaultAuthenticationLevel = 5 (Packet Integrity)
   ```

3. **Restrict Launch Permissions**
   ```
   HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Ole\AllowLaunchActAsInteractiveUser = 0
   ```

### Additional Security Recommendations

1. **Remove Unnecessary Permissions**
   - Remove "Everyone" from all DCOM permissions
   - Restrict "Authenticated Users" to local access only
   - Limit remote access to specific administrative accounts

2. **Monitor High-Risk Objects**
   - MMC Application Class (MMC20.Application)
   - ShellWindows ({9BA05972-F6A8-11CF-A442-00A0C90A8F39})
   - ShellBrowserWindow ({C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880})

3. **Implement Defense in Depth**
   - Enable Windows Firewall rules for DCOM
   - Use IPSec for DCOM authentication
   - Implement network segmentation
